# Election Analysis
## Overview of Project
Analyze testing and budgeting data from a City School District to understand school.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to deliver key indicators for the City School District: 

1. A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics
2. An overview of the key metrics for each school
    - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
    - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
    - School performance based on the budget per student
    - School performance based on the school size 
    - School performance based on the type of school

Additionally, after evidence of academic dishonesty surfaced from Thomas High School, specifically 9th graders. Repeat the analysis to show its impact.

Overall it can be said that there is no significant effect from removing Thomas High School's 9th graders. The data doesn't change significantly; while the metrics remain almost the same, there is still a need to understand how they managed to commit the academic dishonesty. Furthermore, the analysis needs to be repeated with the correct math scores to see their impact. It would be interesting to see if the correct scores have a more significant impact and by how much. 
## Summary
- Overall passing percentage is decreased by 1 tenth and math passing percentage is decreased by 2 tenths
- Specifically Thomas High School decreased the overall passing percentage, but remained in the 2nd place of the school ranking
- Average math and reading grades for 9th graders can't be seen in the grade summary
